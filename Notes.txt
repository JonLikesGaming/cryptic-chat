Things I found out:
	In CSS, putting border-box on position relative elements doesn't affect their 'size' when compared to position absolute elements within or below the original to calculate distance. For example, adding border-top (with border-box and position relative) to a nav will affect the element below (with position absolute) and how many pixels of 'top' are needed to move that element down. I believe this is because

	The above principle will also affect the line-height
